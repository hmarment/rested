## Installation

OS X & Linux:

```sh
poetry install rested
```


## Usage example

TBD

<!-- _For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._ -->

### Config File

Each config file corresponds to one _integration_ or third-party API. Integrations contain one or many _resources_. Resources support CRUD operations by default, with the ability to add additonal methods.

```toml
[configuration]

name = "myapi"
base-url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"

    [configuration.auth]
    # integration level authentication settings

    type = "JWT"
    login-resource = 'auth' # resource containing login method
    login-method = 'signin'  # method to login

[resources]

    [resources.auth.login]
    
    endpoint = "auth/login"
    method = "POST"
    arguments = ["username", "password", "rememberMe"]
    authenticate = false

    [resources.posts]

    [resources.todos.list]

    endpoint = "list"
    method = "GET"

    [resources.comments]

    [resources.albums]
    
    [resources.photos]

    [resources.users]

```

## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
